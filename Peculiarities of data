Peculiarities of the data:

Missing data:
Year 2000, state 21, most of 23, 41,42,47, most of 48, most of 49, 54
Year 1995, counties 8.14 and 12.86 (presumably created by 2000)

States 72 (Puerto Rico) and 78 (Virgin Islands) should be ignored.

In year 2000, states 23, 48, and 49 have absurdly low numbers, if not 0, that don't agree with the other two points.
